## 1. Developer information

## 2. Information we collect

J-Station itself does **not** require you to create an account and does not ask you to enter information such as your name or email inside the App.

However, some information may be collected automatically by third-party services integrated into the App (for example, advertising SDKs). This may include:

- Device information (such as device model, operating system version, language, and mobile network).
- General app usage information (such as screens viewed, session duration, and crash logs).
- Advertising identifiers used for displaying and measuring ads (for example, Google Advertising ID on Android).

We do **not** intentionally collect sensitive personal information such as passwords, financial information, health information, or contact lists.

---

## 3. How we use information

Information collected via the App and integrated third-party services may be used to:

- Provide and operate the core features of J-Station (audio streaming of radio stations and podcasts).
- Improve stability and performance (such as diagnosing crashes and technical issues).
- Display, measure, and improve in-app advertising.
- Understand how users interact with the App in order to improve it.

We do not sell users' personal information.

## 4. Third-party services

J-Station uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you or your device. These services have their own privacy policies.

### 4.1. Google AdMob

We use **Google AdMob** to display banner advertisements in the App. AdMob may collect and use device identifiers and usage data to show personalized or non-personalized ads and to measure ad performance.

For more details on how Google collects and uses data, please review Google’s Privacy Policy and advertising information pages.

You can manage or reset your advertising ID and control ad personalization in your device settings.

### 4.2. External audio sources

J-Station provides access to radio streams and podcast feeds from external providers. When you play a station or episode, your device connects directly to that provider’s servers.

Those providers may collect information such as your IP address and device information according to their own privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third-party content providers.

---

## 5. Data retention

We do not directly store personal data on our own servers for J-Station.

Any data collected by third-party services (such as AdMob or analytics providers) is retained according to their own data retention policies. Please refer to those providers' privacy policies for more information.

---

## 6. Children’s privacy

J-Station is not directed to children under the age of 13 and is intended for general audiences interested in radio and podcasts.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps.

---

## 7. Your choices

- You can disable or reset your device’s advertising ID and limit ad tracking in your device settings.
- You can uninstall J-Station at any time to stop all collection and use of information by the App.

For detailed options regarding personalized advertising, please refer to your device and Google account settings.

---

## 8. Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect information processed through J-Station. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Third-party services that we use are responsible for implementing their own security measures to protect data they collect and process.

---

## 9. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this page.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how J-Station handles information.
